/**
 * A condition is simply an expression. The truth value of a condition needs to
 * be evaluated w.r.t. a KB. By default, this KB is the one that the condition
 * is coming from but conditions can be evaluated w.r.t. another KB (execution
 * environment may be different).
 * <p>
 * In fact, conditions are queries and they are satisfied (true) w.r.t. some
 * {@link OWLModel} if execution of the query yields a non-empty result set. In
 * case of exactly one element in the result set such a query is said to be
 * <em>unambiguously</em> satisfied, otherwise, in case of multiple results it
 * has <em>multiple</em> solutions that satisfy it.

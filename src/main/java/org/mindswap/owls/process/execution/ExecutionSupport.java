/**
 * This interface specifies the methods that need to be implemented for
 * supporting execution of all {@link ControlConstruct control constructs}
 * specified by OWL-S as well as execution of all {@link Process process
 * types}. It is intended to be implemented <strong>only</strong> by
 * OWL-S execution engines. Furthermore, this interface is not intended to be
 * accessible by clients that want to execute some service. In fact, the methods
 * defined in this interface should be called only by the implementations of
 * sub interfaces of {@link ControlConstruct}, c.f.
 * {@link ControlConstruct#execute(ExecutionContext, ExecutionSupport)}.
 * <p>
 * Note that {@link ControlConstruct control constructs} can also be inspected
 * via {@link ControlConstructVisitor}. This provides a general visitor pattern
 * intended for public use (in contrast to this interface which is dedicated for
 * execution engines).

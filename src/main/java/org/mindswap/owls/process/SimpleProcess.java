/**
 * Simple processes provide an (optional) level of abstraction.  They
 * describe themselves in the same way as Atomic processes, but, unlike
 * atomics, they give additional characterization of how they work, in
 * terms of other processes (using the <tt>process:expandsTo</tt> and
 * <tt>process:realizedBy</tt> properties). They are not directly callable.
 * <p>
 * A simple process can be thought of as a <em>view</em> on either an atomic
 * or a composite process. Simple processes provide a means of characterizing
 * other processes at varying levels of granularity, for purposes of
 * planning and reasoning.

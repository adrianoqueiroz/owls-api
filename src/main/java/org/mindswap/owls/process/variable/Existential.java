/**
 * The function of Existential ProcessVars is to identify variables whose
 * scope is the process as a whole, so that when they are bound in
 * preconditions, they can be referenced in outputs and effects.
 * (Technically, their meaning is that "If there exist a set of values
 * for these variables that satisfy the preconditions, then for that set
 * of values the following effects are imposed."  So "existential" is,
 * technically, a half-truth.)  Existentials can be used in composite
 * processes, but their values, once set in preconditions, cannot be altered.

/**
 * Represents a list of <code>OWLIndividual</code> objects. This interface
 * shouldn't be confused with <tt>rdf:List</tt> structure (in this library
 * represented by {@link org.mindswap.owl.list.OWLList}). The sole purpose
 * of this interface is to add some access respectively update methods that
 * do not exist in {@link java.util.List List}. In addition, it adds insertion
 * methods that realize semantics of sets, i.e., prevention of duplicates.

/**
 * Transformators are used to transform arbitrary objects to and from OWL data
 * values or OWL individuals. Note that this includes the special case where the
 * object is also a OWL data value or OWL individual.
 * <p>
 * We may also say that a transformator <em>mediates</em> between two different
 * representations of some data. Most likely this transformation happens on a
 * syntactical level only, that is, maintaining the semantics of the data.
 * Nevertheless, it is also imaginable that a transformator not only mediates
 * different syntactical representations but would also change the semantics of
 * the data as part of the transformation process. The current contract of this
 * interface does not define how far this transformation process can go. This
 * is up to actual implementations.

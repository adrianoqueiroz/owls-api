 * Basic interface for OWL error handlers. {@link OWLReader OWL readers} use
 * instances of this interface to notify them about warnings and errors when
 * parsing some OWL file (into an in-memory model).
 * <p>
 * In terms of its functional specification, this interface is almost equivalent
 * to {@link org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler SAX parser error handler}.

  <!-- OWL-S is still under construction.  Some classes, or
  properties that we expected to need when the construction of the
  ontology started, are no longer of use.
    
    For back-compatibility reasons we maintain them classes, but we
  warn that they are deprecated, so that developers will have time
  to update their code and adheer with new versions of the ontology.
  Still, We cannot guarantee that the deprecated classes will be
  present in future versions of the ontology.  Furthermore, we cannot
  guarantee that the meaning of these classes and properties will be
  preserved after the deprecation.

    radius of a European company that specializes on US domestic
    flights, but delivers tickets only in Europe?.  If you look at the
    flight it deals with the geographic radius is US, if you look at
    the ticket distribution is Europe.  On the other side, why can't
